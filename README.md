# draggable-canvas
### A HTML-canvas which supports dragging, scaling and drawing of objects.

Initially for learning purposes.
It uses RequireJS to modulize the code OOP-style!

If anybody is interested in contributing you're more than welcome :-)

[Demo: ](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LalaDK/draggable-canvas/blob/master/demo/index.html)



# TODO
 - Keeping focus where mouse is when scaling
 - Scaling of one axes only
 - More options customizing everything
 - Refactoring of code
 - More shapes and drawables!
